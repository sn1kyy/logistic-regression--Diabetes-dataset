# Diabetes Data Logistic Regression Analysis

## Description
This project employs logistic regression techniques to analyze medical and lifestyle data from the Kaggle diabetes dataset, with the objective of predicting the likelihood of a patient being diagnosed with diabetes. By examining key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin concentration. The analysis identifies the most influential risk factors contributing to diabetes onset. The insights derived from this model can inform public health interventions, improve early diagnosis strategies, and support data driven medical decision making for at risk populations.



## Business Objective

In this project we work with a dataset available on Kaggle. The data includes information about patients being diagnosed with diabetes and other factors effecting it.

The objective is to determine whether healthcare initiatives should prioritize weight‑management programs, glucose‑monitoring efforts, or enhanced insulin‑therapy support. By interpreting the logistic‑regression coefficients of key predictors in the Kaggle diabetes dataset—such as BMI, fasting‑glucose concentration, and circulating‑insulin levels—we can quantify which clinical factor exerts the greatest influence on a patient’s probability of developing diabetes. These insights will guide strategic allocation of medical resources and targeted prevention campaigns, ensuring that interventions deliver the highest return in terms of early detection, patient engagement, and long‑term disease mitigation.

This analysis empowers stakeholders to make data‑driven decisions about where to focus efforts for maximizing public‑health impact and improving patient outcomes.
